  - One-off jobs.
- A temporal queue that supports infinite recurrence streams.
- A job description schema and format.
- Basic execution of local commands, in a separate component.
- Recording state of executions.
- Notification framework for executions.
  - Console.
  - Email.
- One-way support for crontab files.
