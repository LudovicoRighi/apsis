- search, filtering in JobsList
- web UI for showing run, job as JSON
- control page
  - live log
  - shutdown
  - restart
- split output into its own repo, not sqlite
- sanity checker
  - check for unscheduled runs
  - check for late scheduled runs
  - check for orphaned running runs
  - check for runs that ran late

  - Store job_id instead of job, until that time.

- Round all schedule times to some sane precision?
- Compute elapsed time in UI.
- Time zones in UI.

- Figure out how to handle errors in fetch(), or use something better.
- Better test jobs.
- Figure out what to do about the sanic wildcard route hack.  Submit?
- Webpack setup for web GUI.

- Think about what happens to running jobs when sched is bounced.
- New session / pgroup / ?? for ProcessProgram.
- Login shell for ShellProgram.
- Add env, cwd, and other stuff to ProcessProgram.
- Capture rusage and other usage from ProcessProgram.
- SSH wrapper.

- Auto rerun rules.


cron
- format time with tz
- control precision in time, daytime formats
- parse weekdays (see repo.py)
- load named calendars from files


# agent

- randomize proc_id
- break up `execute()` so that start, wait/update are separated
- async requests in agent client
- serve HTTPS
