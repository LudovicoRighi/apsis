- prevent the same instance from running more than once... HOW?
- gzip output
  - in agent
- use flex layout for run list selection controls
- performance test with lots of jobs and runs
- store schedule horizon per (job, schedule) ???
  - limit number of runs scheduled per job
- nicer job output in CLUI
- add a --since flag, to control how far back to reschedule when creating
- live elapsed time in runs list
- live output for running jobs in run view
- watch jobs for changes
- when a job has changed, cancel and reschedule all future runs?
- search, filtering in JobsList
- web UI for showing run, job as JSON
- support multiple outputs per run in API/UI
  - add option to split stdout/stderr
- sanity checker
  - check for unscheduled runs
  - check for late scheduled runs
  - check for orphaned running runs
  - check for runs that ran late
- test restarting apsis
- define the extension mechanism (program, schedule, etc.)
- kill button for running run
- in RunList, if sorted by time, draw a line at now
- web UI for ad hoc runs
- document API
- watch runs live (poll? websocket?) in CLUI
- CLUI for testing jobs repo
- tooltip for timestamps with local, UTC, (run-local?), and elapsed times
- factor args out of schedule classes
- web UI reconnects web socket automatically
- indicate in web UI when a job started late
- move schedule time out of times; rename times â†’ timestamps
- have agent attempt to recover orphaned processes

  - Store job_id instead of job, until that time.

- Round all schedule times to some sane precision?
- Compute elapsed time in UI.
- Time zones in UI.

- Figure out how to handle errors in fetch(), or use something better.
- Better test jobs.
- Figure out what to do about the sanic wildcard route hack.  Submit?
